## About

[Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv) Audio mod

Music tracks only, no sound effects!

## Which music tracks are included

At the moment the following music tracks are included

- Civilization III music
- Victoria II Music

## But there already are existing mods with these tracks

The following mods already include same music:

- [Civ-3-Music](https://github.com/RobLoach/Civ-3-Music)
- [Victoria-II-Music](https://github.com/Caballero-Arepa/Victoria-II-Music)

However these mods also include sound effects, the aim of this mod however is to provide music only
and no sound effects of any kind.

## Roadmap

I plan to add more music tracks in the future from other 4X games, so that in entire gameplay
no same music plays twice, with the goal to never get bored listening to same thing over
and over again like a broken record.

Separate repository with cherry picked sounds effects since many duplicates exist out there.

## License

I do not hold Copyright of any of the tracks in this mod, no license is provided.</br>
Note that this does not mean that these tracks are in public domain either.

## How to use

- Search for and download `4X-Music` mod using `Unciv`

## Other suggested music mods

In addition to this mod I highly suggest the following mods which are not included since they don't
include sounds:
